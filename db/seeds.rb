# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# user = User.create(username: "Randyr2125", email:"Randyr2125@test.com")
tweet = Tweet.create!(user_id:1, text:"This is my 2nd tweet")
